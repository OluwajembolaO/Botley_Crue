    Q: "How do I figure out the amount of ticks equal to one rotation?"
    A: "Go to the website where you found the motor part. Then, find the Encoder Resolution.
        Ex) Series Yellow Jacket Planetary Gear Motor
                Encoder Resolution: 2786.2 PPR at the Output Shaft
                the amount of ticks will be 2786.2
        Critical Thinking) Think on how we can easily change the amount of ticks if the motor ever changed
