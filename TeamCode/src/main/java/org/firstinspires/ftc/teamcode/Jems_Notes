    Q: "How do I figure out the amount of ticks equal to one rotation?"
    A: "Go to the website where you found the motor part. Then, find the Encoder Resolution.
        Ex) Series Yellow Jacket Planetary Gear Motor
                Encoder Resolution: 2786.2 PPR at the Output Shaft
                the amount of ticks will be 2786.2
        Critical Thinking) Think on how we can easily change the amount of ticks if the motor ever changed

    Q: "How does the movements of the motors work?"
    A: "To properly understand how they move I really recommend watching this video to understand the physics behind it:

    Q: "Ok, I watched the video what is the maximum chunk of code for????"
    A: "Ok this is a good question. Let me break this down to make it easy as possible.
        The controllers have a min and max values of 1 and -1. If you take a look at the]
        video you can see that sometimes there will be total values greater or less than the max.
        This will cause the robot to move wonky since any value greater than 1 will default to 1
        anyways. The ratio wouldn't be the same. For example a ratio of 2.5:1 is not the same ratio of 1:1.

                So, how do we solve this?
                    We can find the biggest velocity from the 4 motors and divide it by each of them to get a
                    perfect ratio while staying on the same direction.
                        Ex) We want to move the bot diagonal at the same time rotate to the right (clock wise).
                            FrontLeftPower  = 1 + 1 + .5 = 2.5
                            FrontRightPower = 1 - 1 - .5 = -.5
                            RearLeftPower   = 1 - 1 + .5 = .5
                            RearRightPower  = 1 + 1 - .5 = 1.5

                            Remember! The min and max values are -1 and 1 so 2.5 and 1.5 will default to 1. The ratios
                            arent the same.

                            The max power that we have here is 2.5 so, we will divide all powers by 2.5
                                2.5/2.5 =  1
                                -.5/2.5 = -.2
                                .5/2.5 =   .2
                                1.5/2.5 =  .6
                            This will maintain the same ratio throughout the robot so that movement is as smooth
                            as possible. Yes the speed is a little bit slower but its worth it for doing precise calculations."
